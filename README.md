# YourControls_JUST_FLIGHT_F28_PROFESSIONAL
Profile to work with YourControls application and MSFS2020. If you find any bugs, please contact me on YourControls Discord: Dkgolfnut_Dennis

Known Issues:
  - Starter switch (1 & 2) - may not stay left or right long enough. the copilot may have to move the switch at the same time as the pilot to get the engines to start correctly.  


*** Please kindly note that this plane from MSFS has numerous unselectable switches. This is a MSFS model/featureset issue, not a YC's or the Profile I created issue.

FIXED: 
   # 8/26/2024
    # - Added Rolling Numbers to HSI 1 & 2 for VOR CRS synch
    # - Added YC's definition for Transponder to help with synch on FREQ changes
    # - Added TCAS RANGE KNOB on Transponder
    # - Corrected APU STARTER BUTTON/LIGHT
    # - Added F28_MCP_HDG_Bug
  
   # 8/11/24
    # - Added LVARS for TABLET Airplane page for CHOCKS/GPU/EFB Movements up/down/left/rightetc. 
  
   #  8/10/24 
    # - ADDED PHYSICS.YAML & SEW MODE to fix planes in different places
    # - ADDED 1 additional LVAR for Left and Right Throttles and fixed typo on 1st Engine parameters 

I recommend that you and your co-pilot first conduct a test flight to check if everything is working properly.
