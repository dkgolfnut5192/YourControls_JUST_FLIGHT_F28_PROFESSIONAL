# It is not recommended to have the EFB save the plane state as this can cause issues with 1 plane being in a different state then the  other. PLease ensure this is unchecked if flying with YC's 

Known Issues:
  - Starter switch (1 & 2) - may not stay left or right long enough. the copilot may have to move the switch at the same time as the pilot to get the engines to start correctly.
  - I had to remove the COURSE 1 and Course 2 synch due to it getting out of synch so quickly. You and your copilot will have to set CRS 1 and 2 individually


*** Please kindly note that this plane from MSFS has numerous unselectable switches. This is a MSFS model/featureset issue, not a YC's or the Profile I created issue.

I recommend that you and your co-pilot first conduct a test flight to check if everything is working properly.
